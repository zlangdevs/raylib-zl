# Raylib bindings for ZLang
Bindings are experimental and generated with `zlang wrap`.

Files:
- `raylib.full.zl` - full autogenerated mapping from `raylib.h` (experimental)
- `raylib.zl.old` - previous manual mapping kept as backup

## Regenerate mappings
From this directory:

```bash
zlang wrap raylib.h -o raylib.full.zl
```

## What is inside `raylib.full.zl`
- Experimental autogenerated structs/functions used by demos
- ABI adapter helpers generated by wrap (`Vector2`/`Color` mappings)
- Built-in linker flags via `#flag` (`raylib` + Linux system libs)

## Why is `raylib.zl` smaller than full raylib?
`raylib.full.zl` is generated from the whole `raylib.h` and shows the direction of full autowrap,
with conservative skips/warnings for unsafe constants and complex wrappers.

## How to use
Compile by passing your source file and one of the generated mapping files.

Full-wrapper demo build:

```bash
zlang demo/neon_grid_3d.zl raylib.full.zl -o demo/neon_grid_3d
./demo/neon_grid_3d
```

Subset-wrapper build (smaller surface):

```bash
zig-out/bin/zlang demo/neon_grid_3d.zl raylib.full.zl -o demo/neon_grid_3d
./demo/neon_grid_3d
```

## Demo
- `demo/neon_grid_3d.zl` - interactive polyforge reactor (animated 3D tower field + reactor core + orbiting energy nodes)

Controls:
- Arrow keys: move 3D orbit target
